# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#School.create(name:'school 1',code:'00001',description:"description school 1")
#School.create(name:'school 2',code:'00002',description:"description school 2")
#School.create(name:'school 3',code:'00003',description:"description school 3")
#School.create(name:'school 4',code:'00004',description:"description school 4")
#School.create(name:'school 5',code:'00005',description:"description school 5")
